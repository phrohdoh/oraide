# `orals`

A library, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), that implements the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification).

There is also an executable target (named `orals`) that clients will execute.

## Development & Testing Tools

There is a script named `mkmsg` located at `./tools/mkmsg` which makes it easy to send message to a running language server.

Read the comments in that file to learn how to use it.

#### Note: Using `mkmsg` and named pipes _appear_ to send extra data to stdin of the server, rendering the input generated by `mkmsg` useless at this time.
